**Timer** is a super-small countdown timer app for windows.
Getting lost in social networking and forgot all about your pending
project, or maybe forgot to get up and move around for 1 min. once every
30 min. This can be a helpful tool for you then until it becomes practice.

You can change the time up sound as well, even an `MP3`. So, dont
put it on some annoying sound that you would simply end up closing the timer.
Put a pleasing, trance music like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5isFGQ7TQOg)
to motivate you. Motivated enough? Press `Stop`. You can also press `Stop`
to pause the timer, and `Start` to contiue.

Start **Timer**. Set the timer and `Start`. You can select any <br>
timeout `Sound` of your choice. Even *MP3* files are ok.
